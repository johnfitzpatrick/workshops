# Chef Hack Day
Join us for a one day hackathon on Chef.  During this session you will take a real working Python application running on Ubuntu consisting of a MySQL database and Apache front-end, and the goal is to convert it to chef.


This as a totally open ended exercise - there may be just a few ‘gates’ to work towards, but with no clear endpoint.  During the class we just point you in the right direction to get you started and be there to give guidance and answer questions. You can work in teams, or go it alone.

Success is determined for each individual differently - for some it might be knowing where to start and having the confidence to trial & error to write something in chef, while for others it could be moving the whole application into Chef.  Go as far as you can on the day and you can take it away and hack on it in your own time.  There are no right or wrong answers - if it works, its right! You can always improve it and layer in best practices later...


This is a chance to hack on a real application, share ideas, and discuss patterns.  It will be fun, challenging, rewarding.
